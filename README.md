# Find_The_Way_OUT
This is a game that I create in SDL C++, with basic plots included. 
In the begin of the game, you are going to become a friend of Lan who is really needing your helps to puzzle the questions of himself.
Lan is a observing person with profound thoughts, though your mission is to not let him be so negative and depressed with his thoughts. Help him find the truth of life and the meaning of it.
To win the game, you must collect all the keys hidden in every parts of it. Do not forget to help Lan when he needs you, once finishing helping him, you will get 1 key.
Good luck!
