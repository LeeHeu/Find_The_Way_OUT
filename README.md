# Find_The_Way_OUT
This is a game that I create in SDL C++, with basic plots included. 
In the begin of the game, you're gonna become a friend of Lan who is really needing your helps to puzzle the questions of himself.
To win the game, you must collect all the keys hidden in every parts of it. Do not forget to help Lan when he needs you, once finishing helping him, you will get 1 key.
Good luck!
